#Charging Algorithms Web

I built this website layout for my [Charging Algorithms Research Project](https://github.com/andhess/ChargeAlgorithms).
It is built in Jekyll and uses Twitter bootstrap.  I also used the sidenav that is featured on the bootstrap website.
It features 3 page styles:
* an about page (for project overview)
* content page (with sections for explaining each aspect of project)
* team page 

Thanks to [@philipithomas](https://github.com/philipithomas) for the Jekyll references.

#Visit

Figuring out hosting right now with my university, will post link soon.

#Use it Yourself

This site can be easily used for any sort of individual or group project.  To use, fork and get started.

#To Do

* make the sidenav float and highlight your current section
* add my own content to it
