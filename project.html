        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>With the growing public awareness of clean energy and efforts towards a sustainable society, the demand for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) has been increasing steadily over the past decade. These vehicles utilize rechargeable batteries or other energy storage devices, and are much more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles.  As these vehicles become more common, the charging demands of of many PHEVs and EVs could raise problems to the power grid - increased demand for electricity and unwanted peak loads due to simultaneous charging.  By having charging stations employ smart scheduling algorithms, increased load can be reduced, and spikes in demand can be more evenly distributed.</p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Research the charging demands of electric vehicles on the power grid</li>
            <li>Create a realistic simulation of EVs arriving at a parking lot with various charging requirements</li>
            <li>Development and implement different scheduling algorithms and compare them on different metrics</li>
            <li>From simulation data, determine which algorithms perform best in particular conditions</li>

        <h3>Model</h3>
        <h5>As with every simulation, ours cannot be a perfect representation of the physical world.  Our Python model simplifies some aspects, but takes most components into consideration.  Below are some of its properties:</h5>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Vehicles arrive with a given charge level, desired charge, a time they need to leave by, and a battery capacity</li>
            <li>Vehicles arrive according to a Poisson Distribution that has a specified average arrival rate</li>
            <li>Charging stations have a limited number of charge ports.  Must schedule vehicles to be charged at certain times</li>
            <li>The charging station will determine how to schedule the vehicle for charging based on the algorithm being used</li>
            <li>Some algorithms use admission control, which will turn a vehicle away if it canâ€™t fully accommodate it</li>
            <li>The algorithms operate in real time.  They do not have any knowledge of future events and make their decisions based off available information.</li>
            <li>Profit is collected from finished jobs.  Partial profit is collected from incomplete jobs with a fixed penalty.  There is no penalty for declined vehicles.</li>
            <li>Vehicles charge at a linear rate - in reality vehicles charge on a logarithmic curve</li>
            <li>All simulations are done in discrete time.  The model advances at intervals of 1 minute</li>
            <li>New vehicles can arrive at the beginning of each minute</li>
            <li>At the end of each minute, charge is given to EVs that were in the charge ports and the algorithm makes calculations to determine if any changes need to be made on the new state.</li>
            <li>Changes occur if EV finished charging, hits its deadline, or a more important vehicle arrived. A vehicle importance is calculated based on the algorithm being used.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Below is a description of the types of algorithms that we built.</h5>
        <br>
        <p><strong>FCFS:</strong> First Come First Serve - EVs are charged in order of their arrival time</br>
           <strong>EDF:</strong> Earliest Deadline First - EVs are charged in order of their deadline<br><br>
           <em>Laxity = 1 - ( time required to charge / total time at the lot )</em><br><br>
           <strong>LLF:</strong>Least Laxity First - EVs are charged in order of lowest laxity<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Simple:</strong> Laxity only calculated upon EV arrival<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Smart:</strong> Laxity is updated every minute<br>
           <strong>DSAC:</strong> Decision Scheduling Admission Control - EVs are scheduled in a profit maximization scheme
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Admission Control:</strong> The algorithm will limit the number of vehicles it accepts<br>
          <strong>Full Admission:</strong> All vehicles are admitted<br>
          <strong>Profit Maximization:</strong> Vehicle are admitted if total profit is predicted to increase
        </p>

        <br>
    
        <h5>The table below details the key differences between each of the algorithms that we implemented.</h5>
