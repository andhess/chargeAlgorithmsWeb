        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>With the growing public awareness of clean energy and efforts towards a sustainable society, the demand for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) has been increasing steadily over the past decade. These vehicles utilize rechargeable batteries or other energy storage devices, and are much more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles.  As these vehicles become more common, the charging demands of of many PHEVs and EVs could raise problems to the power grid - increased demand for electricity and unwanted peak loads due to simultaneous charging.  By having charging stations employ smart scheduling algorithms, increased load can be reduced, and spikes in demand can be more evenly distributed.</p>

    <section id="Goals">
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Research the charging demands of electric vehicles on the power grid</li>
            <li>Create a realistic simulation of EVs arriving at a parking lot with various charging requirements</li>
            <li>Development and implement different scheduling algorithms and compare them on different metrics</li>
            <li>From simulation data, determine which algorithms perform best in particular conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>After reading some papers written by experts in the field (see <a href="sources.html">sources</a>), we outlined which algorithms we thought were important to test and then began weighing out the different options on implementation.  We ultimately decided on building a complete simulation model from scratch in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. This language allowed us to build quickly, without losing too much performance. It also is very easy use from an object-oriented sense, which was vital for a program of this complexity. We built a CSV output system into our model, and then did all data processing and analysis in <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="model">
        <h3>Model</h3>
        <h5>As with every simulation, ours cannot be a perfect representation of the physical world.  Our Python model simplifies some aspects, but takes most components into consideration.  Below are some of its properties:</h5>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Vehicles arrive with a given charge level, desired charge, a time they need to leave by, and a battery capacity</li>
            <li>Vehicles arrive according to a Poisson Distribution that has a specified average arrival rate</li>
            <li>Charging stations have a limited number of charge ports.  Must schedule vehicles to be charged at certain times</li>
            <li>The charging station will determine how to schedule the vehicle for charging based on the algorithm being used</li>
            <li>Some algorithms use admission control, which will turn a vehicle away if it canâ€™t fully accommodate it</li>
            <li>The algorithms operate in real time.  They do not have any knowledge of future events and make their decisions based off available information.</li>
            <li>Profit is collected from finished jobs.  Partial profit is collected from incomplete jobs with a fixed penalty.  There is no penalty for declined vehicles.</li>
            <li>Vehicles charge at a linear rate - in reality vehicles charge on a logarithmic curve</li>
            <li>All simulations are done in discrete time.  The model advances at intervals of 1 minute</li>
            <li>New vehicles can arrive at the beginning of each minute</li>
            <li>At the end of each minute, charge is given to EVs that were in the charge ports and the algorithm makes calculations to determine if any changes need to be made on the new state.</li>
            <li>Changes occur if EV finished charging, hits its deadline, or a more important vehicle arrived. A vehicle importance is calculated based on the algorithm being used.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Below is a description of the types of algorithms that we built.</h5>
        <br>
        <p><strong>FCFS:</strong> First Come First Serve - EVs are charged in order of their arrival time</br>
           <strong>EDF:</strong> Earliest Deadline First - EVs are charged in order of their deadline<br><br>
           <em>Laxity = 1 - ( time required to charge / total time at the lot )</em><br><br>
           <strong>LLF:</strong>Least Laxity First - EVs are charged in order of lowest laxity<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Simple:</strong> Laxity only calculated upon EV arrival<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Smart:</strong> Laxity is updated every minute<br>
           <strong>DSAC:</strong> Decision Scheduling Admission Control - EVs are scheduled in a profit maximization scheme
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Admission Control:</strong> The algorithm will limit the number of vehicles it accepts<br>
          <strong>Full Admission:</strong> All vehicles are admitted<br>
          <strong>Profit Maximization:</strong> Vehicle are admitted if total profit is predicted to increase
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>DSAC is most profitable for low to medium load, then FCFS AC takes over.</p>
        <p><img src="assets/images/profitNonAC.png"></p>
        <p>Non-AC algorithms produce more profit unless there is a very high load or a large penalty coefficient. DSAC has slightly less profit but is far more robust.</p>
        <p><img src="assets/images/successRateAC.png"></p>
        <p>DSAC is best for low to medium load, then FCFS takes over. Success rate is defined as completed EVS / total EVs in the simulation.</p>
        <p><img src="assets/images/successRateNonAC.png"></p>
        <p>DSAC is best overall. Especially once the load increases. Success rate is defined as completed EVS / total EVs in the simulation.</p>
        <p><img src="assets/images/chargeDistancesAC.png"></p>
        <p>DSAC excels. This metric defines how many EVs are at least partially charged. Charging all cars a little is better than charge only some to completion which is less practical in reality.</p>
        <p><img src="assets/images/chargeDistanceEq.png" class="shiftRight"></p>
        <p><img src="assets/images/chargeDistancesNonAC.png"></p>
        <p>All Non-AC algorithms are far better because they partially charge almost every EV but this causes their low success rate.</p>

        <p>Shows how profit is affected with an increasing number of charge ports against an increasing arrival rate on the FCFS AC algorithm.  Note how profit always increases with an increase in arrival rate or the number of charge ports.</p>

        <p>Shows how profit is affected with an increasing number of charge ports against an increasing arrival rate on the FCFS algorithm.  Note how this algorithm doesnâ€™t have nearly the same profit performance as its AC version.</p>
        <p><img src="assets/images/dsacHeatSuccess.png"></p>
        <p>Shows how success rate is affected with an increasing number of charge ports against an increasing arrival rate on the DSAC algorithm.  As expected, success rate remains high with a low arrival rate.  Also observe how a lot can maintain performance at a higher arrival rates when more charge ports are available.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>DSAC is overall the most robust algorithm; it gains very good profit and is able to charge many cars to or close to completion. In small to medium arrival rates, when the success rate is still above 50%, DSAC gains the most profit. However in the very overloaded case First Come First Serve generates the most profit, however it will also decline many vehicles which is not very practical.</p>
        <p>DSAC distributes the total charge given over all EVs much better.  More cars will be at least partially charged but it will not create as much profit as FCFS during peak hours.  This is because many vehicles will not be charged to their full desired charge level.  This could be ideal as more EVs will receive at least some charge and will be able to drive to their next destination such as their home charging station. Also, with an exponential charge rate this would allow many cars to be charged to a usable level as opposed to a full cars charged to an unnecessary full charge.</p>
        <p>For the charge distance vs arrival rate graph, DSAC is the clear winner among all algorithms with admission control (lower on the graph is better).  Charge distance is calculated as the sum of (charge amount desired - charge amount given)2 for every car in the simulation.  This means that all cars are getting some charge will be better than a few cars getting completely charged.  This is a much more practical metric as it allows more cars to be entered into the lot and given at least some charge so that they can get to their next destination. The only algorithms that outperform DSAC in this metric are FCFS and LLF Smart (both without admission control) . Both of these algorithms have very poor performance in profit and success rate.  DSAC arguably offers the best balance between profit, success rate, and charge distance (i.e. practicality).</p>
        <p>In an actual parking lot, DSAC would benefit everyone the most. Many customers would be satisfied and the lot would generate very good profit (if not the most in low to medium arrival rates). In terms of making an EV charging lot that is practical, efficient and profitable DSAC is the clear winner.</p>
